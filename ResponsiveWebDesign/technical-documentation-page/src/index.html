      <p>The present project<a href="#my-project"><sup>1</sup></a> was created by <b>gpm22</b><a href="#me"><sup>2</sup></a> based on the tutorial <b>Intro to React</b><a href="#Intro_to_React"><sup>3</sup></a> by the ReactJS team.</p>
      <p> <b>Tic-tac-toe</b> (American English), <b>noughts and crosses</b> (Commonwealth English), or <b>Xs and Os</b> (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.<a href="#Wikipedia_tic_tac_toe"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

      <p>The objective of the game is to make a linear sequence of <b>X</b>s or <b>O</b>s. The sequence que be a row, a colum, or a diagonal.</p>
      <p>The game is played in alternate turns, where each player takes their turn.</p>
      <p>The first player is the one who plays with <b>X</b> and the second player is the one who plays with <b>O</b>.</p>
      <p>Every move made is saved in a list on the left side of the board, so it is possible to go back to any previous play.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The move is indicated by the order in which it occured and show what was done.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ex: Go to move #1 - X in position (1,2)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
